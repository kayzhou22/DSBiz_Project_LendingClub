# DSBiz_Project_LendingClub

### Lending Club Data Analytic Project for DS for Business at NYU Stern 


This repo is for our collaborative project evaluating **Lending Club**'s decision making on its current loan applicantions and providing suggestions to increase their profitability. 

**Data Source**: [Lending Club Data](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action)

The three folders contain notebooks for <br/>

Our analyses and recommendations in the final write up are based on the results of these notebooks.
